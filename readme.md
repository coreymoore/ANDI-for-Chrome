# ANDI for Chrome - Accessible Name and Description Inspector for Google Chrome

ANDI is a web accessibility testing tool. This repository ports ANDI to a Chrome extension so it can run on pages where the original bookmarklet is blocked by Content Security Policy (CSP).

## What does ANDI do?
1.	Automatically detects accessibility issues
2.	Suggests ways to improve accessibility
3.	Reveals what a screen reader should say for interactive elements

## What problem does ANDI solve?

For many web developers, accessibility is an unfamiliar and complex territory and therefore often neglected. ANDI bridges the gap between developers and end users by revealing
where accessibility issues occur on the page. To accomplish this, it analyzes the HTML of the web page being tested and extracts accessibility related markup.
